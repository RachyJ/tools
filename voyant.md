# Voyant - text reading and analysis

http://voyant-tools.org/

Voyant Tools is a web-based text reading and analysis environment. It is a scholarly project that is designed to facilitate reading and interpretive practices for digital humanities students and scholars as well as for the general public.

Voyant Tools is an open-source project and the code is available through [GitHub](http://github.com/sgsinclair/Voyant).

## Running Voyant Server on Local Machine

To run the server you need to run the VoyantServer.jar Java JAR file. This Java Archive file is a package with all the resources needed to run the server (including an embedded JETTY server). To run this you need to have Java installed.

* Mac: You should right-click (control-click) on the VoyantServer.jar file and choose Open from the menu, then you will need to click on Open in the next dialog (which isn’t the default button).
* Windows: You should be able to simply click on the VoyantServer.jar file.
* Command-line: It should also be possible to launch the application from the command-line if you’re at the prompt in the same folder as the jar file: java -jar VoyantServer.jar
